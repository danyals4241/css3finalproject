        it delivers incredible performance, unmatched power efficiency, and cutting-edge features like NVIDIA Super Resolution Technology. With up to twice the performance of prior-generation cards* and breakthrough graphics technologies, the GeForce
        GTX 980/970 provides an elite gaming experience on virtual reality, HD, and ultra-resolution 4K displays. The table above shows the specifications of the 2 graphic cards in black font. The GTX 980 and 970 are being compared to some last-gen Nvidia
        cards and a AMD card that is competing with Nvidia for the seat in everyone's computer. </p>

        A pristine condition Apple-1 Computer has been auctioned off for 905k dollars!

        <img class="displaymargin" src="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/130522130048-apple-1-computer-story-top.jpg" alt="SS3" height="560" width="790"> An Apple-1 - has been sold for a record $905,000 at an auction in New York. It is one of 50
        Apple-1 computers that were made by Steve Wozniak. This sale was not looking to go low due to it being in almost factory new condition. For comparison, the original Apple-1 was retailed at around $666.66. This sale is almost 1359 times more than
        the original retail price. Although there are other high bid sales of Apple-1s this one took the top. Just to complete the scene, in Germany an Apple-1 sold for $333,000 and another sold for $671,000 due to a letter hand written by Steve Jobs
        sold with it. It is speculated that there are only 14-15 Apple-1s in existence with working capabilites. Most have been carelessly destroyed.

            AMD has decided to challenge Intel by rehearsing their CPU making capibilites. Thus inventing the Ryzen, AMD's new architecture made to challenge Intel's top tier offerings.




            <img class="displaymargin" src="http://core0.staticworld.net/images/article/2017/01/amd-ryzen-pc-cybertron-100702845-orig.jpg" alt="SS3" height="380" width="630"> Intel has been known for a long time in the gaming market for dominating the
            industry in CPU's, thus developing a monopoly. However the existence of AMD decreased the affects of it for the consumer. AMD has been offering budget oriented CPU's that are as half the price of Intel chips but provide sufficient computing
            capibilites like any other. Recently, AMD had been lacking in the department due to Intel having better CPU's. Although both AMD and Intel produce mainly 4 core CPU's, Intel has a better performance per core ratio which attracts consumers
            more. That is going to change thanks to AMD and their new micro architecture, Ryzen. Boasting amazing speeds and insane core counts, Ryzen will dominate the market until Intel releases their new line of CPU's. At CES 2017, AMD unveiled the
            sheer amount of performance Ryzen can deliver on the new AM4 platform. Ryzen has 8 cores and is working on the x86 architecture. It was put to war against the Intel i7 6900k which has 8 cores, 16 threads and a stock speed of 3.7 GHz. The results
            were amazing, for the first time in decades AMD managed to beat Intel's top tier CPU. However, they beat it by 10%. This reveals that the specifications of the CPU will be just around the 6900k. It is easy to tell it will boast a bigger stock
            clock because it performed faster, maybe around 4.5 GHz. This is possible because AMD has kept the 4.5 stock clock universal throughout most of their CPU's. The thing most consumers are hyped for are the prices. AMD has always kept their prices under Intel's. The 6900k costs 1099 dollars, the Ryzen line of CPU's will cheaper and far better. Tough luck Intel! </p>
