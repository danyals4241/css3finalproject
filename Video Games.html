        <img class="displaymargin" src="https://orangemushroom.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/super-smash-bros-for-3ds.jpg" alt="SS3" height="400" width="430"> Super Smash Bros. for the Nintendo 3DS is a wonderful title that can draw in players all around the world
        to fight together and create fierce rivals to SETTLE IT IN SMASH. Like in previous games in the series, Super Smash Bros. is a fighting game in which up to four players use various attacks, techniques, and items to deal damage to their opponents.
        The aim of the game is for players to increase their opponents' damage percentage, causing them to fly back further when attacked, and knock them out of the playing field. Returning items first introduced in Super Smash Bros. Brawl include the
        Smash Ball, which allows characters to perform powerful Final Smash attacks, and Assist Trophies, which summon various other video game characters onto the field to attack opponents or help in other ways. Like its predecessors, Super Smash Bros.
        features collectible in-game trophies based on characters or items seen in various Nintendo or third-party games. Each stage now features an alternate Omega form, which replaces the stage's layout with a flat surface and removes all stage hazards.
