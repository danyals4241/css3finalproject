        A look back at Apple's previous generation phone. The iPhone 6.

        the iPhone series came with the iPhone 5. Following Apple's loss in smartphone market share to companies
        producing phones with larger displays (such as Samsung, whose popular Galaxy S4 model featured a 5-inch screen), reports as early as January 2014 suggested that Apple was preparing to launch new iPhone models with larger, 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch
        displays. Many issues came with the iPhone 6 Plus, the biggest issue was "Bendgate". "Bendgate" is when the iPhone starts to bend slowly in the user's pocket over time. Lewis Hilsenteger at UnboxTherapy (Youtube User, famous for unboxing various things) made a video showing how and where the iPhone bends so you can protect yourself from this "Bendgate". His experiment shows that the bend happens near the volume rockers (buttons), a probable design flaw from Apple's side. The iPhone
        6 hasn't had these issues yet, which is thanks to its smaller screen. </p>

        A look back at the 2014 flagship from Samsung. The Samsung Galaxy S5.
        <img class="displaymargin" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/Samsung_Galaxy_S5.png" alt="SS3" height="560" width="330"> The Galaxy S5 was released on 24 February 2014 as part of the company's presentation at Mobile World congress in
        Barcelona and Spain. Samsung president JK Shin explained that consumers did not want a phone dependent on "eye-popping" or "complex" technology, but one with "beautiful design and performance", a "simple, yet powerful camera", "faster and seamless
        connectivity", and fitness-oriented features. The design of the S5 comes from the design of the S4. It features a rounded, polycarbonate chassis carrying a modern look, faux metal trim and a removable rear cover. Unlike past models, the S5's rear
        cover uses a higher quality soft plastic and is dimpled to improve grip. The S5 ships with Android 4.4.2 Kitkat and Samsung's TouchWiz software. Unlike TouchWiz on the S4, the S5's TouchWiz has been given a more refined interface with a flatter
        and geometric look, although certain aspects of the changes were influenced by a recent patent licensing deal with Google, which requires that Samsung's TouchWiz interface follow the design of "stock" Android closer.
